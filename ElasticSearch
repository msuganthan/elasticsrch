		search, and 
		analyze big volumes of data 
	quickly and in near real time.

	Near RealTime:
	==============
	
		This means is there is a slight latency from the time you index a document until the time it becomes searable.

	Cluster:
	========
		
		Is a collection of one or more nodes that together holds your entire data and provides federated indexing and searchable capabilities accross all nodes.
	
	Node:

		A node is a single server that is part of your cluster, stores your data, and participates in the clusterâ€™s indexing and search capabilities.

	Index:
	======

		Is a collection of documents that have somewhat similiar characteristics. For example, you can have an index for 
		-- customer data, 
		-- product catalog
		-- order data

	Type:
